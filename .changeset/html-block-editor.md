First-class HTML block in the admin editor. The existing `htmlBlock` Portable Text type (produced by the WordPress and Contentful importers) is now a fully editable block in the rich-text editor. Authors can insert an HTML block via the `/html` slash command and edit raw HTML in a textarea. Imported `htmlBlock` content that previously fell through to an opaque `pluginBlock` placeholder is now rendered in the same editable UI. The inline (visual-editing) editor preserves HTML blocks as read-only placeholders to prevent data loss.
